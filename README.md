# Space Invaders

A classic space invaders game implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game runs smoothly at 60 FPS with no frame drops, thanks to the use of the `requestAnimationFrame` method and thorough optimisations.

In addition to the classic gameplay, this project also includes added skin customisation, a pause menu and score banner that displays the timer, current score, and remaining lives.

Whilst working on this project, I had the opportunity to learn about and practice various web development concepts and technologies, including:

- DOM manipulation
- Event loops
- FPS optimization
- CSS transform and opacity properties
- Web performance optimization using developer tools on Firefox and Chrome
- Tasks such as JavaScript execution, style calculation, layout, painting and compositing

To play the game, simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
